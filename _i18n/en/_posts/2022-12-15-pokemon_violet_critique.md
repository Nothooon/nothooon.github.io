Recent pokemon games have a huge problem

## A bit of context

Pokemon Violet and Scarlet are the latest entries in the mainline Pokemon games series. It has been out for nearly a month already. Pokemon Violet has sold 10M copies in only 3 days, which blasts away any previous record: best start for a Switch game, for a Pokemon game, for a Nintendo game and for a console exclusive game. But there is one problem: the game truly is mediocre. And that's really a pain, more about it later. First, let's talk about the game itself.

## The basics

In essence, Pokémon Violet is still a classic Pokemon game.The game starts like every previous game: we meet a professor, they make us choose a starter, and then, you're thrown into the world to start your adventure !

![Pokemon Violet's Starters](/assets/img/articles/pokemon_violet/starters.jpg)

This time, we're exploring the Paldea region, a new region inspired by the Iberian peninsula (or Spain, if you prefer). The game also introduces a school that is quickly relegated to the background.Of course, there are also tons of new pokemons to find and catch.

How does this game differenciate from the previous one ? Well there are two major differences:

- It's the first mainline, fully open-world, Pokemon game
- There are three paths to chose from that you can explore freely (more on that later)

After being pleasentaly surprised by Pokemon Legends: Arceus, I expected Game Freaks to learn their lesson and finally release a new, modern, polished Pokemon game that would be worthy of the most popular and most lucrative IP on this planet. There are big chances that you played the game or heard about it in some way, so you probably know that __Game Freaks, yet again, disappointed us :)__
Let's talk about it in full length

## The illusion of free choice

Early on, we learned that the game was broken down into three distinct stories and that we could follow these stories (as well as those stories' objectives) in any order. Those 3 paths are:

- Victory Road : Challenge 8 Gyms, then the Pokemon League to become the next Champion
- Path of Legends: Chase after 5 Titans to find some mysterious plants and use their power to cure a very weakened pokemon
- Operation Starfall: Challenge all of the Team Star's leaders to stop this evil~ish organisation

![Pokemon Violet's Map](/assets/img/articles/pokemon_violet/map.jpg)

For each of these paths, you are free. You can face the arenas, bosses, and titans in any order you want. You can also switch from one path to another at any time, so you are truly free, in theory. Because even if this freedom is really nice and necessary in a game that wants to be open-world, Game Freaks forgot one very slight detail: __there is no level-scaling.__

As you can see on the map I put above, each objective has a predefined level and each arena champion or team star boss has one and only one team already planned.
So contrary to what the game says, there is a pre-set order. There is nothing to stop you from going against the strongest champion first. But if you do this, then your team will be way too strong and you'll run over the rest of the game, which I think ruins the fun of it, especially since it offers tougher fights than usual (we'll come back to that later).

It is also a problem if you follow the planned order. Complete an entire path in the pre-set order. Congratulations, your team is now level 50-55, which is much higher than the starting level of the other stories (~level 20). We face the same problem again: if you keep the same team for the three stories, you lose a big part of the challenge offered by the game.
 
If you're wondering what this level-scaling might look like, I can redirect you to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/xqrp85/if_you_could_fight_the_johto_gym_leaders_in_any/) by u/I_Am_The_Bookwyrm who re-imagined Johto's champion teams with level-scaling based on your number of badges and frankly, it makes me dream a bit.

I think the level-scaling could have been done on two levels. The first is the simplest: level-scaling within stories. The Gyms champions have a different team depending on the number of badges you have earned this far, which ensures a balanced challenge no matter what order you choose. This is the freedom that an open-world should offer. Especially since you always have the strategic advantage of choosing your opponent (and therefore you have the possibility to prepare yourself, to adapt to your future opponent).
 
Second option: the same kind of level-scaling but extended to all possible paths. More complicated to balance, but it would also be a very good thing to really reach the level of freedom that a game with the formula proposed by Pokémon Violet could offer.

In any case, the proposed difficulty curve does not correspond to the freedom the game tries to provide. The player has to make a choice, conscious or not, between the freedom of exploration and the challenge offered. Imposing handicaps was fun in the old games and their closed world. Forcing players to do so in a game that advocates freedom is stupid.

## What about the difficulty ?

Pokémon games have always been very simple, especially for an adult audience, which has known the mechanics of the series for many years now. This is still the case for this opus. Beyond the lack of level-scaling problem discussed earlier, the game follows in the footsteps of its predecessors. Nevertheless, during my playthrough, I met some tougher opponents, especially at the end of the game. I'm thinking in particular of the 5th titan and the following fight in the Path of Legends, the last battle (after you've completed all 3 paths) and the electric gym (I don't think it's more difficult than the others, I just struggled with it personally). 

As an indication, here is my team at the end of the game, just after the last battle:

![My team at the end of the game](/assets/img/articles/pokemon_violet/team.png)

With this team, I was able to prevail against the final opponents of the game but I was not sweeping their entire team. I think that this slightly increased difficulty at the end of the game comes from the fact that the trainers use a lot of the new Pokémon of this region whose weaknesses I did not know. And that's a good thing. Not only to showcase the new Pokémon, but also because __it's about time the difficulty of these games increased.__ Was there a real good step in this direction, or am I the one who is getting bad? Time will tell.

As I write this article, I haven't touched the post-game yet, so I don't know if there's a super tough trainer/combat waiting for me (I can feel one last little surge of power from Nemona coming).

# A really painful open-world

I mentioned that the game is an open-world, but is it really one? The world map is really open. Once you get past the prologue, you can really explore the entire map on the back of your mount. Sure, some places will be difficult to access without upgrading your mount's abilities, but theoretically, you can go anywhere. That's good, that's what we expect from an open-world game: to be able to get demolished by enemies that are way too strong for us from the very beginning of the game (Territorial Rotbart my beloved).
Unfortunately, once again, all this is very quickly ruined. The first thing that will jump out at you is the graphics. __The game is ugly, really ugly, even for a Switch game.__

![A beautiful landscape](/assets/img/articles/pokemon_violet/landscape.jpg)

To make matters worse, these ugly textures take a long time to load, there are huge clipping problems (elements that appear and disappear in front of us in a somewhat random way) and textures that flicker. NPCs animations go down to 5FPS if they are too many of them or if they're more than 10m away from you. Finally, FPS drops are frequent (sometimes even freezing completely for one or two seconds!), making the game heavy and painful to play. It's not uncommon to fall below 20FPS, and don't expect to exceed 25FPS, the game can't run that well.

Drive around Paldea for a few minutes and you too will experience all these technical glitches. The technical aspect of the game is a failure. I also didn't mention the long loading times (loading menus, fights, boxes, etc...). I even got to the point of complaining about the game when I inadvertently triggered battles against wild Pokemons!

I take advantage of this part on the technical aspect of the game to mention in bulk the other bugs and problems I could meet.

- Pokemons ou PNJsstuck into walls
- Landscape elements appearing or disappearing randomly (sometime even the ground I'm standing on..)
- Mount stuck in an endless fall after jumping (while being on the ground, of course)
- Really strange lighting at the entrance/exit of caves (it seems that the game switches to daylight to be able to light the caves, which creates strange lighting when you come out)

## The gameplay saves it right ?

The battle system does not change, again, it is classic Pokémon. Some mechanics have been change a bit, like the day care. There is no day care in this game, instead, the new Pic-Nic mechanic allows you to make your Pokemons breed. And how do you do that? By waiting several real minutes. In exchange, you get the benefit of being able to do this anywhere/anytime and have multiple eggs in one picnic. As with everything in the game, any positive aspect is balanced by negative aspects.

Another example of this phenomenon is tera raids. Pokemon Sw/Sh's dynamax raids are back with a few changes. These raids are still fun and provide good rewards. Sw/Sh's life system (three KOs and you and your companions are ejected from the raid) is gone. Instead, you have a certain amount of time to complete the raid and each time your Pokémon is knocked out, its respawn time increases. So what is it that hinders the quality of these raids? The attack order is not indicated and is not clear at all. Sometimes all Pokémon will attack at the same time, sometimes the enemy Pokémon will attack several times in a row, but you'll never be told why. This makes the raids a bit more frustrating than the Sw/Sh raids for no good reasons.

On the other hand, a very big positive of Pokemon Violet is the accessibility of the strategy side of the game. Getting competitively viable pokémon is always laborious. IVs, nature, moveset, eggmoves, talents, all of these parameters that are crucial to getting a competitively viable pokemon were far too dependent on luck, resulting in hours of grind to build your team. In Pokemon Violet, many of these aspects can be easily controlled by the player. Items to modify nature, copy eggmoves, obtain hidden talents and change tera type. TMs are back to single-use but can be crafted in any Pokemon center. The only thing the player cannot control are the IVs of their pokemons. This approach had already started in Sw/Sh and is very well continued in Violet/Scarlet. The icing on the cake: the future compatibility with Pokémon Home will allow you to recover your previous companions you trained in the previous games and transfer them to your save of Violet.

## A very interesting story

This is the last part before the conclusion, hang in there!

The story of the game is, in my opinion, really good. Although it is still in familiar territory, the game tries some interesting things. Each path wants to give you the same message: it's the others that push us to always do better and transcend our limits. But each path does it in its own way, with its own vision of the message. Beware of spoilers below !

The Victory Road tells you that having a rival allows you to surpass yourself, to give your best and reach new heights (Goku also thinks that, it must be true). The Path of Legends shows us a young man who relentlessly pursues his goal, however dangerous it may be, because it is his last hope to save his dearest companion. And Operation Starfall in my opinion wants to explain to us that sometimes it is necessary to make difficult decisions if it helps your friends (the sense of sacrifice in a way).
Personally, I felt these messages very clearly, and it is thanks to the writing of the characters and the dialogues. __I believed in the stories I was being told, I felt their weight__. Especially in The Path of Legends, I really felt Arven's doubt not knowing if his treatment (and last hope) would be successful. I felt the joy and hope that was reborn in him after seeing that it was indeed successful, feeling him with a new, unstoppable energy. 

The conclusion of the story (available after finishing the three stories) deals with much more raw and mature subjects (even confirming the death of characters who had been by your side for the whole game) and was a really unexpected conclusion. In this same final sequence, we get to see our companions interacting together for the first time in the game and once again, I believed in this group dynamic. __The chemistry works!__

The whole is carried by an exceptional soundtrack, as always. The music is superb, especially the fight themes (Toby Fox and all...). So with all this effort to create an engaging story, why in God's name is there no dubbing of the characters? Why didn't they dub ANY of the cinematics in the game? This is a real conundrum in my opinion, voice acting is the one thing that the game is really missing to make its story truly shine and stuck in the memory of all players. To give you an example, I invite you to take a look at [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Dr_Bonehead/status/1597444716106481665?t=KoWJ_dbOWNnctl2e6lLODA)

That's it, I've talked about everything I wanted to talk about in this game, it's time for the conclusion.

## The Big Conclusion

As you will have understood as you read on, __Pokemon Violet is a frustrating, disappointing and sometimes painful experience__. The game shows us a really great potential ruined by disastrous technical performances and strange, even inconsistent game design decisions. I've heard and read a lot of thoughts like "the game is really good if you forget about the technical problems", but I don't agree. The technical aspect is an integral part of a game, you can't just ignore it and pretend it's not there.

Pokemon Violet is not finished, it cannot be the final version of the game as imagined by Game Freaks. To me, it's shameful to release a game in this state. The Switch has already shown that it is capable of running much more beautiful and full open-world games: Zelda Breath of the Wild and the Xenoblade trilogy to only name four.

I mentioned in the introduction that the sales of the game were excellent and that this was a problem. But why? I think you'll have understood it by reading my review of the game, but these sales records don't bode well. Game Freaks serves us a dirty copy, unworthy of such a license, but the sales are there. Sure, the game is the worst rated of all the mainlines, but people are buying it anyway, and people LOVE the game. So don't put words in my mouth. If people are having fun, great, I had fun too in the end. 

However, if we want the license to evolve and the games to really improve, we have to complain, show that we don't accept this level of quality. Pokemon players are too lenient and as long as things are the way they are now, Pokemon will not evolve (ironic huh?).
 
I want Pokemon to make me dream again, as it made us all dream in our childhood.
