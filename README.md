# Personnal Website

## Prerequisites

- ruby > 3.0.0
- gem > 3.2.3 

## Installation

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of
the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.
Then, follow [Chirpy's install guide](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/)

All of this is technically optional since you can just edit the markdown file and push them to the repos and it'll work.  
But you won't have access to any feature, including local building/hosting of the doc to see how what you write renders.

## Translation

I tried setting up i18n, and it works but it's a hastle since I need to write each article once per language.
So if you wanna translate some of my stuff for me, first of all, thank you very much :)
And then, please do it on a `translate/article_name` branch then create a pull request to main. I still want to check what goes on my website.
